Welcome to the repository for the unsupervised learning tutorial lecture of the *Machine Learning 
and Quantum Computing for Quantum Molecular Dynamics* (MLQCDyn) school hosted by the Pascal Institute 
of the University Paris-Saclay. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with Python code to 
demonstrate, in practice, the application of the popular unsupervised learning methods (dimensionality
reduction and clustering) to analyze molecular dynamics data and extract useful chemical insights. The
popular [MD17 database](http://www.sgdml.org/#datasets) generated from *ab initio* molecular dynamics 
simulations is used as a motivating example for the analyses presented in the tutorial.

## Main topics covered in this tutorial 

- Dimensionality reduction
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA);
  - Kernel PCA.

- Clustering analysis
  - Hard partition clustering with K-Means;
  - Evaluation metrics for clustering.

## Requirements

The tutorial was designed to run in a jupyter notebook environment with

- python3 (tested with version 3.8.1)

The following Python packages are necessary to run the tutorial:

- Math and data processing libraries:

  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn

- For visualization:

  - seaborn
  - matplotlib

- Specialized packages for chemistry:
